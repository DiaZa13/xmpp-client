<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è
 5. Execute the xmpp-client (make sure you still on client directory)
   ```sh
   java -jar .\target\xmmp-client-1.0.jar
   ```
   When you execute the project it will print you out a menu where you can log in into an exisiting account or create a new account on the XMPP server. Once you are logged, you can type **-help** to request the option menu. One of the most importante features develop was to sent and receive files, to test this feaure you will find o the main directory a folder named *files/send* on wich you have to save the files you want to send, and also you will find *files/received* folder where you can find the files somebody else sent you.
